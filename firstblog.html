    How the boy who dreamed of a defense got into computer science?

Hello and welcome everyone to my very first blog of coding journey.
    </p>
Just as every boy dreams of serving his country when he grows up and gives his participation in the development of the country, in the same way,
I also decided that I will also serve my country by joining the defence.
As I grew up, I started getting interested in technology as well. When I completed my schooling I saw that my friends have been preparing for IIT. I did not know anything about IIT, 
so I took admission in a coaching institute after completing my 10th class after taking information about IIT from my friends and started preparing because I was interested in technology.
During the preparation of IIT, I came across many distractions which I could not understand because at that time I was in my teenage and
 I needed a guide but at that time I had no guide because of which I knew what was going to happen. 
Failed in my IIT exam because my preparation was not complete due to distractions.
Then I thought that what I had dreamed as a child, to serve the country by joining the defense, I started preparing for the defense.
During the preparation, I started working on the physical as well as written, as everyone knows that it is also necessary to be physically fit to join the defense.
Preparation continued, the exam came, I gave the exam and I passed the exam, after that I started working harder on physical, 
that day has also come, I have also qualified physical, which I could have done by preparing.
Now comes the medical test and I come to know that I am medically unfit which I cannot cure.
Then I decided to choose my old  computer science field, so after collecting information that how can I go to computer science field again, then I came to know about BCA and MCA that I can take admission in NIT for mca by giving nimcet exam, 
THEN I took admission in BCA in PATNA SCIENCE college and continued my studies, but even after that,
I did not give up the stubbornness of going to defense, on the belief that I have to do something by going to the army.
And I cracked the defense exam 6 times but I got failure only . I get medically unfit again and again.
Then, getting frustrated, I focused on my computer science studies.
 And I went back to the entrance exam of NIT along with my bca studies because if I had to do computer science then I have to do it from IIT NIT only.
But this time I had thought that the mistake was made while taking IIIT JEE preparation in Twelth Board, that is not to be done.
And I did complete focused studies during my NIMCET preparation and after hard work I cleared the NIMCET exam and got admission in 
nit raipur,
after many failures finally i can say its my achievement.
now i can proudly say i am NITian now
that was i dreamed before
